Transition Model NN Notes
----------------------------------------------------

Transition Model
------------------------------
Losses:
- Residual: between human precondition and autoencoder 
- Residual: between human postcondition and autoencoder 
- Cost: difference between predicted current action (unscaled log prob) and actual current
- Cost: difference between predicted next action (unscaled log prob) and actual next

Training:
- Minimizes the total loss between residusals (loss scaled by 0.1) and costs

Embodiment Mapping Model
------------------------------
- Minimizes residual loss between human ground truh and robot data
- Residual is computed in the autoencoder space
  - Human autoencoder and robot autoencoder space are different, but the network just minimizes the residual
